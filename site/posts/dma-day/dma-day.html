<p>’Twas the night before the <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en">Act</a>, when all through the EU,<br>
A few tech giants were stirring, a new future in view.<br>
Regulations were drafted by the Commission with care,<br>
In hopes fair competition soon would be there.</p>

<p>The third-parties nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
While visions of open markets danced in their heads.<br>
And I with my laptop, having read the decree,<br>
Had just settled down for what was about to be.</p>

<p>When out on the Web, there arose such a clatter,<br>
I launched <a href="/posts/twitter-mastodon/">Mastodon</a> to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to <a href="https://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a>, I flew with a click,<br>
Opened new tabs, to absorb the news quick.</p>

<p>The moon on the cusp of the new regulation’s birth,<br>
Gave a luster of hope to the watchers of Earth.<br>
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
But designated gatekeepers, with a message so clear.</p>

<p>Malicious compliance, so banal and on brand,<br>
I knew in a moment <a href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/margrethe-vestager_en">St. Vestager</a> must stand.<br>
More rapid than eagles, threats of fines came.<br>
She whistled and sighed and called them by name:</p>

<p>“Now, Alphabet! Now, Amazon! Now, Apple and ByteDance!<br>
On, Meta! On, Microsoft! It’s time to advance!<br>
To the end of your chokehold! To the end of your stonewall!<br>
Now comply away! Comply away! Comply away all!”</p>

<p><em>To be continued...</em> <strong>Happy DMA to all and to all a fair fight!</strong></p>

<p>Context: The Digital Markets Act went into effect for the first round of designated gatekeepers on 2024-03-07. <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/the-digital-markets-act-is-in-force-what-happens-now/">A legal review from Open Web Advocacy</a> covers where gatekeepers are failing to comply with the DMA on day 1 and the changes app developers still need.</p>
