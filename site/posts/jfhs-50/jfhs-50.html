<h2>Transcript</h2>

<p>Good morning, JF. Today is some day, August x-teenth, 2022. I’m Jeremiah. And this is <em>Cavalier Corner</em>. Well, not really. This is my home in Stockholm, Sverige, or Sweden.</p>

<p>I wanted to share this video since I won’t be able to join the 50th anniversary of the school and the 20th anniversary of the Class of 2002’s graduation in person.</p>

<p>In high school, I spent a lot of time in a closet. Not just because I’m gay and wasn’t out yet, but because in 1999, I was part of a group of students who created JF’s video morning announcement show, <em>Cavalier Corner</em> and our first studio was in a tiny closet in the library.</p>

<p>When JF was renovated, a great new studio space was created in 2016. The studio was <a href="/posts/the-mary-vinoskey-cohick-studio/" title="The Mary Vinoskey Cohick Studio">named</a> in honor of my mom, Mary Vinoskey Cohick. She graduated from JF in 1980. We even had some of the same teachers, a generation apart. Unfortunately, she passed away when I was in the seventh grade.</p>

<p>And one of the ways that I dealt with that pain was to get involved in my community and extracurricular activities. <em>Cavalier Corner</em> gave me a reason to smile and say good morning, even when I didn’t feel it. That meant a lot to me. It was one of the many opportunities to create that helped me find a successful career.</p>

<p>I’m also forever grateful for my experiences on the Sabre yearbook staff, the Student Council Association, and DECA.</p>

<p>Education and community institutions matter more than I ever appreciated as a teenager. I hope this video message finds you well, with a heart and a head open to new ideas, different perspectives, and forever seeking truth.</p>

<p>Happy 50th, JF. Now, go make it a good day.</p>
