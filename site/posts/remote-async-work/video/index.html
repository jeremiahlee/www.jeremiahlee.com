<p>Recording of my talk at the <a href="https://itworkplace.letsmanageit.pl/?ref=JeremiahLee.com"><em>IT Workplace of Tomorrow 2021</em></a> conference on October 26, 2021. It was based on my <a href="/posts/remote-async-work/"><em>Remote Async Work zine</em></a>.</p>

<p>If your first experience with remote work was during the pandemic, I am sorry. You did not get the best first impression. Let’s start over by getting into the mindset of opportunity instead of necessity. Let’s explore what asynchronous collaboration should look like, how to support it as leaders, and how to know if it is successful.</p>
