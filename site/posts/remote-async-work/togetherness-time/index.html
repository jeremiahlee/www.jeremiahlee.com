		<p>Remote asynchronous work does not eliminate the need for human connection. Fostering community and camaraderie is a valid reason to have a synchronous meeting, but you will need something more than virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_fall?ref=JeremiahLee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust falls</a>.</p>
		<p>I created <em>Togetherness Time</em>, a weekly 25-minute meeting on Friday in place of our daily standup. The name may sound hokey, but it is explicit in intent. The objective is for people on the team to get to know each other as their full selves, not just the person who works virtually beside them. While early Internet users can attest to the community building power of async, text-only communication, we have video meetings now and should use them.</p>
		<p>Several people I managed said it was their favorite meeting of the week. Some would even show up for the meeting when they were on vacation. Here are some of the activities the team liked most.</p>

		<p class="border border-red-600 p-4">Not everyone will feel comfortable participating as the subject of the exercise, so ask for volunteers and reassure the team that it’s ok to not host. As a manager, I did each of the exercises first to demonstrate and then ask for a volunteer to go next.</p>

		<h2 id="home-tour" class="font-black my-4 text-center text-3xl">Home tour</h2>
		<p>This idea is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Cribs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>MTV Cribs</em></a>, the show where celebrities showed off their homes. The place we choose to live and the objects we keep reveal much about us. Each week, a different person from the team would take us on a tour of their home. We did one person per meeting, so this activity spanned a few months’ worth of meetings.</p>

		<h2 id="journey-maps" class="font-black my-4 text-center text-3xl">Career/Life Journey Maps</h2>
		<p>Share the highs and lows of your journey using a line graph with an x-axis of time and y-axis of bad-to-good. Put notable moments as points on the graph. How much of the timeline and how vulnerable one wants to be is up to the host. Some people may only share professional highs and lows. Others may share how their personal and professional lives have intermingled.</p>

		<h2 id="over-or-under" class="font-black my-4 text-center text-3xl">Over or Under</h2>
		<p>Take popular topics of conversation and ask if they are overrated or underrated in quick succession. No further discussion. Pick topics relevant to the interviewee and audience. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> is a great source of topics.</p>
		<p>Some example trends to rate:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-8">
			<li class="mb-0">Bitcoin</li>
			<li class="mb-0">Elon Musk</li>
			<li class="mb-0">The LA Dodgers</li>
			<li class="mb-0">Miami</li>
			<li class="mb-0">Mini cupcakes</li>
			<li class="mb-0">Sourdough bread</li>
			<li class="mb-0">TikTok</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="40-questions" class="font-black my-4 text-center text-3xl">40 Questions</h2>
		<p>40 questions in 20 minutes (because it’s <a href="/posts/remote-async-work/practices/#sacred-meetings">a 25 minute meeting</a>) is inspired by <a href="https://www.vogue.com/video/series/73-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vogue’s <em>73 Questions</em></a>. The interviewee has 30 seconds to answer each question.</p>
		<p>Here are some example questions. Mix and match.</p>
