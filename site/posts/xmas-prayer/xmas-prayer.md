To the figment of our imaginations,

May we find solidarity as we talk to you<br>
when we should be talking to each other

when we know the wars around us,<br>
both personal and political,<br>
continue to be fought.

As we focus our thoughts on something larger than us,<br>
let us open our eyes, raise our heads, and see<br>
each other as ourselves.

May you guide us in finding our own strength, purpose, and compassion<br>
until we no longer need to imagine our capabilities<br>
as they become realities.

Truth and peace.
