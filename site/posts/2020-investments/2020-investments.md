I am excited to announce my latest investments: Wifi Dabba, Aptera Motors, and Easy Solar.

<h2 id="wifi-dabba"><a href="https://wifidabba.com/?ref=JeremiahLee">Wifi Dabba</a></h2>

<p>$25,000 franchise agreement</p>

Wifi Dabba is creating the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> for the next billion users in India. Less than 7% of India has broadband access. Service expansion has been inhibited by the challenges of building an underground fiber network. With backing from YCombinator and VY Capital, Wifi Dabba created a laser-based (free-space optical communication) <a href="https://wifidabba.com/tech?ref=JeremiahLee">router</a> capable of 100 <abbr title="gigabits per second">gbps</abbr>. The company is now building a <a href="https://wifidabba.com/network?ref=JeremiahLee">100-point mesh grid network</a> to bring affordable and high-quality Internet access to the 11 million people in Bengaluru. Instead of more venture capital, the company is selling 6 year franchises of each point-of-presence with a guaranteed minimum rate of return.

Facebook and Google have both attempted digital colonialism as ISP operators in emerging markets. I believe in the power of the Internet, but I believe it is best brought to market by entrepreneurs in those markets. I believe in Karam Lakshman and Shubhendu Sharma as founders. I think their strategy of a coalition of franchise investors is smart in retaining control of their business and sustainable for the expected investment-to-return ratio. Bengaluru is the first city, but I foresee both the technology and business model working in many other places.

As of now, there are only 40 franchise opportunities still available in Bengaluru. <a href="https://wifidabba.com/buy?ref=JeremiahLee">More info</a>

<p>$1,000 regulation crowdfunding</p>

2008 was an exciting time. President Obama got elected, I got married, and I pre-ordered the most innovative electric car at the time. Some of my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Ajeremiahlee%20aptera">earliest tweets</a> were about getting to see an incredible prototype in 2009. Sadly, the company closed when it was not able to secure the same federal loans that sustained Tesla. A decade later, the company has reformed with an updated ambition and a new prototype: an electric car with a 1,600 km (1,000 mile) range with 64 km (40 miles) on solar power alone.

I no longer live in a place where I need a car, but I believe affordable electric mobility is a smart bet on the future. Aptera is taking advantage of <a href="https://help.wefunder.com/#/getting-started-for-investors/304615-so-wefunder-is-like-the-stock-market?ref=JeremiahLee">Regulation Crowdfunding</a> and it is my first investment of this kind. <a href="https://wefunder.com/aptera?ref=JeremiahLee">More info</a>

<h2 id="easy-solar"><a href="https://trine.com/loan/easy-solar-2?ref=JeremiahLee">Easy Solar</a></h2>

<p>€1,000 loan via <a href="https://trine.com/just-invested/131255?ref=JeremiahLee">Trine</a></p>

<p><img src="/posts/2020-investments/easy-solar.jpg" alt="Woman pushing a button on an Easy Solar home control"/></p>

<p>90% of the rural population in Sierra Leone does not have access to electricity today. The country is among the lowest electrification rates in the world. Easy Solar is a leading provider of off-grid solar products in Sierra Leone, where over 50,000 households now use its products. This loan finances the manufacturing of solar lanterns, solar home systems, and larger custom systems.</p>
