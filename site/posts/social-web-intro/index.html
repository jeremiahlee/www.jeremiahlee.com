		<p>When I graduated, I joined my professional tech peers on Twitter. As my social circles moved to Instagram, SnapChat, and Tumblr, I followed them there too.</p>
		<p>I left out countless other social apps to keep the story short. For me, finding community online has been a nomadic journey for two decades. I set up a space for myself, switched my attention, and stayed until the party moved elsewhere. A good social network lasted 3 years. Many didn’t even make past 6 months.</p>

		<p>Meta’s and Twitter’s ability to outwit, outplay, and outlast its competitors provided relative stability for over a decade. They established unprecedented global dominance. </p>
		<p>Social networks that were popular in just one country, like Orkut in Brasil, died off and people moved to global spaces. I saw the Arab Spring upend governments far away and Black Lives Matter awaken my home country in the same place online.</p>
		<p>For a while, Facebook and Twitter seemed like brands that would be around the rest of my life. However, these digital empires now show early stages of decline similar to those of physical empires. They became too big to govern uniformly. The people being governed are restless. External powers challenge their economies.</p>

		<p>Fortunately, we do have another option. It requires going 2 steps back to go one giant leap forward.</p>
		<p>Long before I joined MySpace, I had a GeoCities website. In 7th grade, I learned HTML in my school’s computer class. Everyone made a webpage about something they were interested in. We presented our webpages and then linked to the ones we thought were most cool. Many of us would go on to have blogs  in highs school. And we’d subscribe to each other’s RSS feeds to see everyone’s posts.</p>
		<p>When Twitter first arrived, it was described as micro-blogging. Its big innovation was that it lessened the effort to post online, so people posted a lot more. Another big difference from our blogs was that we could comment without having to go to each other’s website.</p>
		<p>Now, these are not major technical innovations. And some smart people who created the technical standards for the Web knew this and they figured out a way for the <em>Web</em> itself to become a social network.</p>

<div id="just" class="container mx-auto md:flex pb-4">
	<div class="pb-4 md:pb-0 md:w-1/2 md:pr-4">
		<a href="#just"><img src="/posts/social-web-intro/slide-11.webp" loading="lazy" alt="The next great social network is just the web. Screenshot of https://activitypub.rocks"></a>
	</div>
	<div class="md:w-1/2">
		<p><a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> is a technology standard that turns any website into a social network profile that can be followed, liked, and commented upon. You don’t need to know anything about this technology other than that it exists.</p>
		<p>HTML is for the content of a webpage. Cascading Style Sheets are for making the content look pretty. ActivityPub is for making a website social.</p>
		<p>The Web has always been the best platform for creators. It was designed for anyone to be able to share information easily—literally originally for scientists to share research with each other and only much later for 7th graders to post about their football teams.</p>
		<p>The Web’s decentralized design means there is no billionaire you can upset who can arbitrarily ban your website.</p>
		<p>But until ActivityPub, the Web—as a technology platform—had been missing the capabilities that made social networks, well, social.</p>
		<p>The only problem left was that in the 2010s, no one wanted to use the then new standard because everyone was already using Twitter and Instagram at the time.</p>

	<div class="md:w-1/2">
		<p>The European Commission, however, recognized the problems of a US monopoly on global communication after the 2016 elections. It started investing in open source software that used the ActivityPub standard.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="md:w-1/2">
		<p>Some of those investments helped fund the advancement of Mastodon (a Twitter-like app), Pixelfed (an Instagram-like app), and PeerTube (a YouTube-like app). All of these new apps use the ActivityPub protocol.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="federation" class="container mx-auto md:flex pb-4">
	<div class="pb-4 md:pb-0 md:w-1/2 md:pr-4">

Right is several much smaller circles of varying sizes with the Mastodon logo on them. They are surrounded by smaller groups of people proportional to the size of the circle. Lines connect every circle to the other circle."></a>
	</div>
	<div class="md:w-1/2">
		<p>However, the biggest difference between Mastodon and Twitter is that it is decentralized.</p>
		<p>Think of Mastodon as a <em>technology</em> more than a company. For example: email is a technology, but there are lots of different email providers, like your work, your university, Gmail, and Hotmail. It does not matter which email provider you use, you can send an email to anyone.</p>
		<p>Similar to email, Mastodon is a technology with lots of service providers. There is a network of thousands of independently managed Mastodon community servers. Once you join a server, you can interact with people who use any other server. We don’t all have to use Outlook to send email to each other and we should not have to all use Twitter to send tweets to each other.</p>
		<p>This decentralized technical architecture is called federation. Each server is autonomous, but uses the same technology to be able to interoperate.</p>
		<p>Federated social networks shift the power from a handful of companies deciding how billions of people should interact online to a multitude of smaller communities who can better self-manage. Each server operator can decide its governance model, like what behaviors are acceptable on the server and how to handle bad behavior on other servers. Individuals can find the server that best aligns with their ideals or start their own.</p>
		<p>If you feel comfortable operating your own website, you can have full control over your social web profile. Most businesses and organizations probably will want to do this, but most individuals are probably going to join a community server managed by someone else.</p>

		<p>I believe that many of the behavioral problems of social networks will go away with this local self-governance because it brings in-person social expectations into the digital space.</p>
		<p>Community servers are run by people who care about cultivating a community. If you’re a jerk, they’ll kick you off the server. If you run your own server and are a jerk, other community servers can block your server the same way we block email spammers. There’s no faceless corporation using AI to make decisions. It’s a real human who cares.</p>
		<p>As a society, we already have decades of experience dealing with spam and illegal content on online forums and email. The social web is an extension of the web. The same abuse tools and laws created for other parts of the web can be used on the new social web too.</p>

		<p>Much of the bad behavior on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube is by design. These apps have been designed to keep you scrolling and keep you engaging, whether that’s healthy engagement or not, so you see more and more ads. That’s how they make money.</p>
		<p>Social web apps like Mastodon don’t rely on advertising for revenue, so your attention is not being manipulated or sold. They just want to show you content of people you chose to follow.</p>
		<p>You can run your website with social features for less than €10 a month. Community servers like Mastodon cost more to operate. A server for 1000 people costs around €150/month, but that’s just 15 cents a person a month. Many community servers operate as co-ops or on a donation basis. It’s like how Wikipedia is free for everyone, but gets more than enough donations from a small percentage of visitors to operate.</p>

		<p>The Nordic Council, the main forum for official co-operation between Nordic countries, published a report last year on an approach to democratic debate in the age of Big Tech.

		<p>I’m fortunate to have spent the last year getting to work as an open source software developer to make the choice easier for people and I think they’re ready for mass adoption. But it doesn’t matter if some programmers make the best software in the world. The value of a social network comes from the people who are present. </p>
		<p>I’ve chosen to be less present on big tech apps and to be more present on social web apps. I want to stop being a digital nomad. The social web finally allows people to build their forever home.</p>
