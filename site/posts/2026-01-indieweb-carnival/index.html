<p>The <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb Carnival</a> is a monthly <a href="https://indieweb.org/blog_carnival">blog carnival</a>. At the beginning of the month, a volunteer host picks a topic. The host collects submissions until the end of the month and then posts a summary of all the submissions with the links.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading posts from the IndieWeb carnival over the last year and decided to host this month’s with the theme of the meaning of life. The number 42 is presented as “the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything” in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"><cite>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</cite></a>. I will turn 42 years old on January 15.</p>

<h3>Some prompts</h3>

<p>The theme is open-ended, but here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What or who gives your life meaning?
	<li>Do you desire a strong sense of purpose? Why or why not?
	<li>Have you ever had an existential crisis? What triggered it? How did you get thru it?
	<li>What do you want people to say at your funeral? Does that desire influence your behavior in any way?
</ul>
