<li><p>Jack Dorsey (hilariously, ironically) got bullied off of his own platform for supporting RFK Jr, resigned from Bluesky’s board, rejoined Twitter, endorsed Elon’s leadership, and gave an exclusive first interview with far-right website Pirate Wires.

<li><p>Bart’s Twitter account is full of pro-Trump, pro-Bitcoin, and “debanking conspiracy” retweets. Too many to screenshot, but lots of praising Trump and right-wing US politicians. Source: <a href="https://x.com/pbartstephens">https://x.com/pbartstephens</a></p>

<li><p>Bradford’s Twitter account is less active, but has many re/tweets with anti-Democrat messages, specifically Senator Elizabeth Warren, the (brilliant) person who led the creation of the US’s consumer financial protection agency after the 2008 global financial crisis.
