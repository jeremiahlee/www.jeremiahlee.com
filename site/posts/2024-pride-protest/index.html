<p>Pride started as a riot and a protest. The fight for justice continues, even as we celebrate progress. My protest sign for the 2024 Stockholm Pride parade raises awareness of the <a href="https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/2022-eu-csam-feedback/">proposed EU chat control legislation</a> that would eliminate end-to-end encryption of messaging apps.</p>

<p>Sverige’s parliament voted in June to support the proposed legislation in the EU Council of Ministers. The next EU vote is this fall. I want the political parties walking by tomorrow to see a message of opposition.</p>

<p>Queer people have been surveillance targets of governments and police when laws restricted their existence and when they organized to protest for equality. Due to social stigmas that continue today—even in Sverige—many queer and questioning people rely on secrecy for their comfort and safety. Privacy is a fundamental human right that has been essential for organizing the advancement of every other civil liberty. We cannot lose the right to digital privacy simply because there are some bad people in the world.</p>
