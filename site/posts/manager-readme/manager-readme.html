<p>Hi, I’m Jeremiah Lee. My pronouns are he/him (they/them also fine).</p>

<p>This document is my way of introducing me to you as a manager, what you can expect from me, and the best ways of engaging with me. It is a living document updated over time. It is inspired by <a href="https://managerreadme.com/" rel="noopener">ManagerReadMe.com</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/my-user-manual" rel="noopener">personal user manuals</a>. If you write one for yourself, I would like to read it.</p>

<p class="italic">If we have not met yet, you can read about me as a person <a href="/about/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>My role</h2>

<p>As a manager, my goals are to:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Help the business succeed</li></p>
	<li><p>Build high-functioning teams</li></p>
	<li><p>Support your career growth</li></p>
</ol>

<h2>My management philosophies</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p>I view management as a task in creating the ideal conditions for great work to occur. I believe you are able to do your best work when you are well-rested, have the resources you need, and feel psychologically safe.</li></p>

	<li><p><em>Tight, loose, tight.</em> I will be tight (explicit) on setting goals and expectations. Then, I will be loose in giving you the autonomy to figure out the best way to meet the objectives. The level of autonomy is determined by demonstrated skill. Finally, I will be tight on followup by evaluating how the objectives were met.</li></p>

	<li><p><em>Smart organizational defaults</em> help groups of people work effectively. Practices and processes should best serve the people affected by them most directly. I need your help in defining, supporting, and evolving them. If you do not understand why we do something, please ask. If you have an idea for how we can better collaborate, please say so.</li></p>

	<li><p>Speed is important. However, working intentionally at a sustainable pace is more important than working quickly.</li></p>

	<li><p>Family comes first, whether biological or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_choice" rel="noopener">chosen</a>.</li></p>
</ul>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<h3>Async by default</h3>

<p>I assume all chat messages and emails do not require an immediate response. If you need a response from me sooner, tell me. I will do the same when I need a response from you by a certain time.</p>

<p>I use chat for most communication. I prefer to discuss in dedicated channels instead of direct messages so that others can follow. Mention me to get my attention.</p>

<p>I turn off notifications on my devices when I am not working. I encourage you to do the same. If you need me urgently after hours, call or text me.</p>

<p>My response times:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Phone calls and texts: immediately. I am on iMessage and <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener">Signal</a>. Please use it only when something cannot wait until the next business day.</li></p>

	<li><p>Chat messages: end of day, but often sooner, as I check hourly when not in meetings</li></p>

	<li><p>Email: my next working day</li></p>
</ul>

<p>My response time expectations of others:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Phone calls and texts: as soon as possible. This means there is an urgent customer emergency. I will use only if absolutely necessary.</li></p>

	<li><p>Chat messages: end of work day</li></p>

	<li><p>Email: end of next work day</li></p>

	<li><p>If I chat or email you during off-hours, I do not expect a response until your next working day.</li></p>
</ul>

<h3>Scheduling meetings</h3>

<p>My calendar is semi-public. You can schedule time to meet with me at any time that is available. Please include objectives for the meeting in the invitation so I can prepare for the meeting.</p>

<h3>Collaborating</h3>

<p>When given new information, I often need time on my own to think before responding. When I do not have an immediate response, I will listen, note an action item, and get back to you. If I am quiet in a meeting, I am listening and thinking, not ignoring or aloof.</p>

<p>Tell me bad news early. The more time we have to evaluate potential risks and mitigate them, the better.</p>

<h3>How I best receive personal feedback</h3>

<p>I prefer to receive constructive feedback synchronously (i.e. meeting or video chat) so that I can fully understand it. I prefer to have conversations rather than need to guess inferences or implications. I—like most people—am bad at mind-reading.</p>

<p>I view feedback as a gift. Timely, specific examples and suggestions for how I can do better are appreciated. If I do something that bothers you, let me know. I recognize there is a power dynamic in our working relationship. You cannot offend me, I can handle anything, and I do not believe in retaliation for providing feedback.</p>

<h2>1-on-1 meetings</h2>

<p>One-on-one meetings are a regularly scheduled time for us to chat about your needs, frustrations, feedback, ideas, career growth, and whatever else may be of interest to your professional development. They are yours to lead. I may have some items to discuss, but I will defer to your agenda. They are not for giving me a status update, unless that is what you want to discuss.</p>

<p>I would like to talk with you regularly about:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Professional growth, career goals, and how I can support you</li></p>
	<li><p>Highlights and lowlights for you—professionally or personally—since we last met</li></p>
</ul>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p>I have many <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/work-matters/201002/strong-opinions-weakly-held-wisdom-the-courage-act-your-knowledge-and-the" rel="noopener">strong opinions weakly held</a>. Please do not assume my position is immovable. Please do not assume my position is correct simply because I present it confidently. I actively try to counter my natural tendency here, but am not always successful. I care more about arriving at the best outcome for the customer than I do about being right.</li></p>

	<li><p>I bring my whole self to work. I am likely to share personal aspects of my life at work. You do not have to reciprocate.</li></p>

	<li><p>I often have delayed recall of people’s names, even for people I have known for years. It is a brain thing, nothing personal.</li></p>

	<li><p>I prefer fist bumps over shaking hands.</li></p>
</ul>
