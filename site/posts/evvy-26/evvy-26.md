<h3>My speech</h3>

> I've been nominated 8 times in 4 years, but this is my first EVVY! And it's such an honor to win with this team and this project.
>
> There are too many people to thank in 30 seconds, so i've listed them on my website just so that i can share this:
>
> Dr. Jane Shattuc said, "All media is now new media," and she's right. We are the iGeneration, the internet generation. We are the first generation to have every means of professional media production for personal use and we will be the first generation to leverage the only medium that is going to matter in the next century.
>
> I interned this past fall, graduated in December, and have worked non-stop for five months in LA. I assure you this: The Hollywood system is scared of us because they know we are the first generation that's not going to let their system suck away our art for their bottom line.
>
> We've got to return to the liberal intellectual property laws that our country established in our Constitution and make a real living with our art to influence the world.
>
> It's not idealism. It's what can happen when we make Expressions Necessary to Evolution. I'm proud to be part of the people in this room tonight. It's been a great four years Emerson, peace!
