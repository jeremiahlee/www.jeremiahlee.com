<p>Estimate user stories by thinking about the solution effort, additional testing effort, and risk level. Assess the solution effort, then increase the estimate if testing effort or risks exceed typical levels.</p>

<h2>Solution effort</h2>

<h2>Testing effort</h2>

<h2>Risk level</h2>

<p>Risks should be explicitly stated and actions to address each categories with <abbr title="Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated">ROAM</abbr>.</p>
<dl>
	<dt class="font-medium">Resolved</dt>
	<dd>the risk is known and should be stated, but does not need action now</dd>
	<dt class="font-medium">Owned</dt>
	<dd>someone has taken ownership of addressing the risk, but not yet resolved</dd>
	<dt class="font-medium">Accepted</dt>
	<dd>the risk cannot be resolved, so it has to be understood and accepted for what it is</dd>
	<dt class="font-medium">Mitigated</dt>
	<dd>a plan has been created to eradicate the risk</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Bugs don’t get points because fixing what’s broken is not delivering new value. Otherwise we could get double accounting for a feature poorly completed.</p>
