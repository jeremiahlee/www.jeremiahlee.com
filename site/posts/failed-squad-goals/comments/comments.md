## Reaction

In just a month, over 135,000 people read my <a href="/posts/failed-squad-goals/" title="Spotify‚Äôs Failed Squad Goals">article</a>. That‚Äôs more than twice as many people who live in the county where I grew up. I am humbled and amazed at the response. Thank you to everyone who read it, shared it, and discussed it.

## A Clarification

My article was about Spotify-the-model, not Spotify-the-company. Despite the subheadline ‚ÄúSpotify doesn‚Äôt use ‚Äòthe Spotify model‚Äô‚Äù, some people seemed unable to disconnect the two.

I intentionally did not discuss Spotify-the-company beyond Spotify-the-model in my article. That would be airing the company‚Äôs dirty laundry publicly, which I refuse to do. I will only say that few of my former Spotify coworkers who have experience working at other successful tech companies would describe Spotify‚Äôs actual way of working as ideal or desirable, but it is improving.

I will let Spotify speak for itself in describing how it actually works. I think Spotify has not shared its current way of working publicly because it‚Äôs still figuring it out and the methods that are working are refreshingly unoriginal. There is no opportunity for Spotify to be a thoughtleader on process again, but there is an opportunity for Spotify to set the record straight.

## About the cover

I received 3 comments from people who disliked the cover image. They all seemed to miss the reference to Taylor Swift‚Äôs excellent <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo">Bad Blood</a></cite> music video about squad goals. They also seemed to not read the explaination [at the end of the article](/posts/failed-squad-goals/#about-cover).

## Some people hated the editorial design

I believe in the value editorial design brings to the principal content. This was my first attempt to bring magazine-style layouts to the Web using modern CSS layout features. Some people did not like it. Some people did. I welcome constructive criticism. It‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt like it. I create for myself and not everything has to be for you.

<blockquote><p>In one of my prior roles they were running the full Spotify model when I joined. I pushed us to kill for it two of the reasons in this article. 1) I am not a fan of matrix management. It makes ownership unclear and makes manager-employee relationships difficult. It‚Äôs hard to have meaningful conversations when your manager really isn‚Äôt focused on your actual work. 2) the assumed collaboration/coordination capability. Coordination and collaboration are hard - one of the reasons I‚Äôm a huge supporter of the Technical Program Manager role. These folks provided the dedicated ownership of cross team activities to make sure stuff gets done - so it isn‚Äôt left to good intentions.</p>‚ÄîAsanka Jayasuriya, CTO at SailPoint <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6657959449669570560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6657959449669570560%2C6657974535951835136%29">April 20, 2020</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I worked at a startup that switched to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/squads?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#squads</a> pretty soon after Spotify blogged about them.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was a disaster. Months were lost.

## People noted the harm the idea had done to the industry

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact that the vast majority of both technical and organizional blog posts by startups are &quot;aspirational&quot; rather than reflecting reality is part of the reason our industry is so full of bad ideas and bullshit <a href="https://t.co/Yy7OqxTsSR">https://t.co/Yy7OqxTsSR</a></p>&mdash; Camille Fournier (@skamille) <a href="https://twitter.com/skamille/status/1253676711050428418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2020</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyway, whenever you read a company blog post about the amazing new process/methodology/structure they&#39;re using (or any company blog really), head to your nearest ocean, and evaporate yourself the largest pinch of salt you can. 5/5</p>&mdash; Braedon (@braedon) <a href="https://twitter.com/braedon/status/1256122571281424384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Read this before cargo-cutting into your own organisation‚Äôs Spotify model.

## Longer responses

- Marty Cagan [agreed with me](https://svpg.com/spotify-vs-fitbit/) and then took [a hard turn into crazy town](/posts/failed-squad-goals/comments/spotify-vs-fitbit/)
- CTO of Groupe leboncoin [shared](https://medium.com/leboncoin-engineering-blog/the-spotify-model-leboncoins-experience-feedback-9f43bf734d05) he thinks the model can work, even though they don't use part of the model anymore
