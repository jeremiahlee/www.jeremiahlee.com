<p class="dropcap">Of all the allures of startup culture, few are more desireable than the speed and nimbleness of a small team. Maintaining that feeling as a company grows is a challenge. In 2012, Spotify shared its way of working and suggested it had figured it out.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I was excited to see <em>the Spotify model</em> in action when I interviewed for a product management role at its Stockholm headquarters in 2017. However, the recruiter surprised me before the first interview. She cautioned me to not expect Spotify to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development?ref=JeremiahLee">Agile</a> utopia.</p>
<p>I joined the company after it had tripled in size to 3,000 people over 18 months. I learned the famed squad model was only ever aspirational and never fully implemented. I witnessed organizational chaos as the company’s leaders incrementally transitioned to more traditional management structures.</p>
<p class="mb-0">When I asked my coworkers why the content was not removed or updated to reflect reality, I never got a good answer. Many people ironically thought the posts were great for recruiting. I no longer work at Spotify, so I am sharing my experience to set the record straight. The Spotify squad model failed Spotify and it will fail your company too.</p>

<p>You can read and watch the <a href="#1">original content</a> in less than 30 minutes or <a href="#spread-4">skip to the next section</a> if you are familiar. Here is a brief summary.</p>
<p>Spotify had teams it called <em>squads</em> because it sounded cooler (not joking). A group of teams were organized into a department called a <em>tribe</em>. Each team was intended to be an autonomous mini-startup, with a product manager acting as mini-CEO for a feature area. The teams had designers and software engineers with a range of specializations. The intent was that a team should have every skill necessary without needing to rely on another team for success.</p>
<p>Product managers had a traditional management structure. A product manager for a team reported to their department’s product director (<em>“tribe lead”</em>). Same for designers. Software engineers, however, were managed outside of the team structure.</p>

<div class="max-w-sm">
<p><em>“Chapter leads”</em> managed software engineers specializing in a specific type of software development across the department. For example, all of the software engineers working on backend APIs across all the teams within the department would have one manager and all of the Android mobile engineers in the department would have a different manager. The intent was to allow engineers to move between teams within the department to best meet business requirements without them having to change managers.</p>

<div class="max-w-sm">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green">Spotify fixated on team autonomy</h3>
<p>When a company is small, teams have to do a wide range of work to deliver and have to shift initiatives frequently. As a company grows from startup to scale-up, duplicated functions across teams move to new teams dedicated to increasing organization efficiency by reducing duplication. With more teams, the need for a team to shift initiative decreases in frequency. Both of these changes allow for teams to think more deeply and long term about the problems they are scoped to solve. Faster iteration, however, is not guaranteed. Every responsibility a team cedes to increase its focus becomes a new cross-team dependency.</p>
<p>Spotify did not define a common process for cross-team collaboration. Allowing every team to have a unique way of working meant each team needed a unique way of engagement when collaborating. Overall organization productivity suffered.</p>
<p class="mb-0">The Spotify model was documented when Spotify was a much smaller company. It was supposed to be a multiple part series, according to Anders Ivarsson. Autonomy made the first cut, but the parts on alignment and accountability were never completed.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green">Collaboration was an assumed competency</h3>
<p>While Spotify gave teams control over their way of working, many people did not have a basic understanding of Agile practices. This resulted in teams iterating through process tweaks in blind hope of finding the combination that would help them improve their delivery. People lacked a common language to effectively discuss the process problems, the education to solve them, and the experience to evaluate performance. It was not really <em>agile</em>. It was just <em>not-waterfall</em>.</p>
<p class="mb-0"><em>“Agile coaches”</em> were internal consultants Spotify provided teams to teach and suggest process improvements. While well-intentioned, there were not enough coaches to help every team. A coach’s engagement with a team was rarely long enough to span a project’s completion to help a team evaluate performance. More so, they were not accountable for anything.</p>

<p class="mb-0">When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Scrum</a> introduced new meanings to a bunch of words like <em>burn-down</em> and <em>sprint</em>, it did so because it introduced new concepts that needed names.

It gave the illusion it had created something worthy of needing to learn unusual word choices.

<p><em>(Just kidding. There are no quick fixes.)</em></p>
<p>You might have discovered the Spotify model because you were trying to figure out how to structure your teams. Don’t stop here. Keep researching. Leaders of companies that have withstood longer tests of time have written far more than Spotify blogged. Humans have been trying to figure out how to work together for as long as there have been humans. The industrial age and the information age changed some of the constraints, but academics studying organization theories have found timeless truths about what humans need to be successful in a collective.</p>
<p class="mb-0">Turns out, Spotify in 2012 had not figured out how to maintain the speed and nimbleness of a small team in a large organization. The company evolved beyond its eponymous model and looked outside of itself to find better answers. You should too.</p>
