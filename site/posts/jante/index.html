<p>Danish-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose wrote about the rules of a fictional, small Danish town called Jante in his book <a href="https://archive.org/details/lit-no-9000-sandemose-en-fugitive-crosses-his-tracks-reduced"><cite>A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks (1933)</cite></a>. While fictional, the disapproving attitude towards expressions of individualism and personal success are real parts of Scandinavian culture.</p>

<p>I’ve lost count of how many times Swedes have replied <em lang="sv">jantelagen</em> to me when sharing difficulties or frustrations with <a href="/posts/till-sverige/#majoritarianism">immigration</a>. I admire the aggressive egalitarian ideal of Sverige, but am puzzled by the use of it as a maximum instead of a minimum.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante">Law of Jante</a> is a behavior to be unlearned, not admired. <strong>It’s time for Janters to go to therapy.</strong> Fully formed adults with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/articles/emotional-intelligence-can-drive-success">emotional intelligence</a> replace a <a href="https://www.headspace.com/mindfulness/there-will-always-be-more-overcoming-scarcity-mindset">scarcity mindset</a> of fear with the abundance mindset of seeing possibilities, even when resources are limited.</p>

<p>I am not a therapist, but I have had years of therapy. Below are the <em>laws of Jante</em> crossed out and replaced by a healthier thought. Instead of telling <em>outsiders</em> how to act, the healthier thoughts help a Janter focus on <em>their</em> own behavior. Curiosity replaces fear. Growth opportunities replace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking">zero-sum thinking</a>. Compassion replaces retaliation.</p>
