<p>In January, I <a href="/posts/2026-01-indieweb-carnival/">asked</a> people to share their thoughts on the meaning of life as the 2026-01 <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb Carnival</a> theme. The submissions made me think, cry, and feel connected with humans I have never met. Thank you to everyone who shared!</p>

<p>My submission: <cite class="bold"><a href="/posts/fixer/">Fixer</a></cite>. I turned 42 on January 15. The number 42 is presented as “the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything” in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"><cite>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</cite></a>. I still do not know the meaning of my life, but I do know the type of work that gives me a sense of purpose and a few songs good songs to listen to when I need that “big world, small me” feeling.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>Presented in the order received with my favorite lines that I hope entice you to read the full post</p>

    <p>No, I do not find any reason to think that there is any meaning to life, although people and their lives do matter.</p>
    <p>There’s no point in finding “purpose” if you don’t have the energy to enact it, because that would just be even worse.</p>
    <p>Existential crises happen on the regular, most commonly like clockwork on my birthday, and that’s just the deal.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://andrei.xyz/post/bear-necessities/">Because, at the end of the day, living begins at the end of your comfort zone. And once you realize this and understand that living is actually just being happy with the life you’re having, or understanding the things you need to change are do-able and actually can do them, then you can improve your life and feel you’re living.</blockquote>

Marie Currie was doing experiments on the soil because of curiosity. Maria Montessori simply didn’t want to see children in such a state. Hildegard was Hildegard. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was doing diligent work that changed our understanding of the start. As did a lot of other scientists, whose data was later used.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://jamesg.blog/2026/01/16/nature">
    <p>The topic of this month’s IndieWeb Carnival is the meaning of life. I think this is one of these questions that is answered over a lifetime; an answer that builds with the years.</p>
    <p>There are many things that give my life meaning – that give me energy and make me who I am. Family, friendship, kindness, hope, life itself, realising that I’m part of a story that extends so far into the past and will continue extending in the future, the feeling of awe when I see something that someone made, the feeling of awe from Nature, the joy of noticing details, learning, music, art.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some folks answer this question with something like “Being a good human being.” While this may seem timeless at first, even if you can’t be sure that you won’t turn into a dickhead in a few years, it generally comes with the problem of perspective. To whom am I a good person, who sees me that way, and are there people who judge my behavior completely different? An angel to one person, a devil to another. At first, you can only go by your own perspective, which is strongly influenced by the culture you live in.</p>
    <p>[. . .]</p>
    <p>But just as I do not need answers from a God, I also do not need an answer to the question of the meaning of life.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Defining the meaning of life solely by its beginning or end is too limited to me. What gives life its Meaning? Why, and How, are we even here? What even is Reality?</p>

    <p>Certainly, a part of the answer must be to learn: about the world, and our place in it; about our relationship to others; about our own nature. Another big part of it must be Love in all of its kaleidoscopic forms. I find myself unable to answer this question fully, just like many who have asked this question before me. Perhaps that is another aspect of the meaning of life: to keep questioning, to keep searching.</p>
    
    <p>Our continuous search for the Meaning of Life is part of the very definition of what makes us human.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://chameth.com/the-meaning-of-life/">Each apple could be the last one you ever have. If you knew that in advance, how would it change your approach? You’d probably savour it a bit more, appreciate it a bit more, and most of all not take it for granted. There’s a lot of pithy sayings about treating each day as if it’s your last, but at that level they’re a lot more nebulous than helpful; appreciating an apple, though? That’s something I can do.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://meadow.cafe/blog/0037-meaning-of-life/">
    <p>I find it in creating things, in active participation in what’s going on around me (living with intent, even though I don’t always manage it), in caring for my family and those around me. I also find meaning in trying to unravel all the traps we set for ourselves in our own minds.</p>

    <p>A butterfly has no goal. There’s no action it’s doing that’s specifically oriented towards something grander than just surviving. Nor does a flower have any goal, nor does a cloud, or a bird, or a river. Nothing in the natural world is doing anything but <em>dancing to the tune of life</em>.</p>

    <p>I’ve come to a “if nothing matters then everything matters” resolution. There is no meaning, so we can make meaning.</p>
    <p>This approach also has flexibility. The meaning can change without it undermining previous meanings. Where and how I’m finding meaning can be one thing now, another thing in the future.</p>
    <p>Right now I’m leaning towards trying to be a good person. That’s what I want to be doing with my life.</p>
