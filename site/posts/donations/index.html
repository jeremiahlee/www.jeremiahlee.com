<p>When I was a kid, my parents taught me to give 10% of the money I earned to the church. I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe">tithed</a> from my allowance and birthday card money under their and god’s watchful eyes when the offering plate passed by me every Sunday. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Nazarene">Nazarene Church</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Amway</a> multi-level marketing scheme my parents believed in seemed to agree on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology">prosperity theology</a>. “If god cannot trust you with a little bit of money, he won’t be able to trust you with more.” My mother must have done budgeting gymnastics to stretch their lower-middle class income to account for god’s needs when they had 4 children.</p>

<p>I appreciate my parents teaching me the responsibility individuals have to fund the future they want to see. While we differed in our motivations and visions for the future, I still donate 1–10% of my income.</p>

<p>Here are some organizations and initiatives I support financially because I believe they are building heaven on earth.</p>
