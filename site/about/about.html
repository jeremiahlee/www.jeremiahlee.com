<h1>Hi, I'm Jeremiah.</h1>

<p>I <span id="age">was born in 1984</span>. I married my wonderful husband <span id="marriage">in 2008</span>. I immigrated to Stockholm, Sverige (Sweden) from the United States <span id="immigration">in 2017</span>. I previously lived in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Boston, and rural Virginia and Tennessee. I work in tech and have been employed by Stripe, InVision, Spotify, Fitbit, Disney, Apple, and a bunch of failed startups. I consider myself an activist and care greatly about digital human rights and the environment. I enjoy traveling, reading, and <a href="/posts/">writing on my blog</a>. I am the founder of <a href="https://ananas.eu/">Ananas Teknik</a> and currently a <em>solopreneur</em>.</p>

<h2 id="tidbits">Tidbits</h2>

<ul>

<li id="personality"><p>I am an <a href="https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-6-skeptic">Enneagram Type 6</a>.</p></li>

<li id="switch"><p>I once shared my experience switching to Mac OS X in a commercial for Apple. I said my legal name in the commercial and I had an above average online presence in 2002. This resulted in much unwelcomed contact and criticism for a high school student who hadn't yet figured himself out. It also led to several incredible friendships and job opportunities. This was an experience that happened <em>to</em> me, as opposed to something I accomplished. It was exciting at the time, but I'd much rather talk about the active decisions, accomplishments, and failures in my life.</p></li>

<li id="dx"><p>I popularized the phrase "developer experience" (DX) to describe the use of user experience research and design methodologies for developer-focused products. Prior to my <a href="/speaking/">writing and speaking at conferences</a>, there were no Google results for the use of this phrase in this manner.</p></li>

<li id="helicopter"><p>I survived a helicopter crash. It was my first time riding in a helicopter. I've taken one helicopter ride since then. As far as I'm concerned, helicopters only have a 50% success rate.</p></li>

<li id="environment"><p>I have been an environmentalist since I was 10. I adopted a plant-based diet over a decade ago because reducing meat consumption is the most significant thing individuals can do to reduce their carbon footprint, after flying less. A whole-foods, plant-based diet also has <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/">scientifically conclusive health benefits</a>. I avoid dairy for lactose intolerance reasons.</p></li>

<li id="politics"><p>Politically, I believe in both capitalism and a guaranteed minimum income. I agree with Robert Reich on most economic issues. In US American politics, I tend to agree with democratic socialists. I don't have a strong party affiliation in Sverige.</p></li>

<li id="rights"><p>I believe that the human right to privacy is a requirement for the right to free speech. We'd be crazy to not fight for both. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle">harm principle</a> should be the only restriction a goverment places on freedom of expression. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">paradox of tolerance</a> is the correct content moderation policy for the private sector to enforce: extending tolerance to those who are intollerant risks enabling the dominance of intolerance and therefore we must be intollerant of intollerance.</p></li>

<li id="mom"><p>My mom died of cancer when she was 34. I was 12. Every child should get the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet"><abbr title="Human Papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</a>. (<a href="/posts/mom-monologue/">Poem</a>, <a href="/posts/the-mary-vinoskey-cohick-studio/" title="The Mary Vinoskey Cohick Studio">Memorial</a>)</p></li>

<li id="gay"><p>I am gay. My identity has been defined more by the struggle for acceptance and equality of my sexuality than by my sexuality. I think of myself as many other things before being a gay man. I hope this is what equality eventually should feel like. (<a href="/posts/explicitly-me/" title="Explicitly Me">Coming out gay post</a>)</p></li>

<li id="religion"><p>I was raised in a very conservative Christian environment, but now am a secular humanist and non-theist. (<a href="/posts/fairy-tale-ending/" title="Fairy tale ending">Coming out non-theist post</a>)</p></li>
