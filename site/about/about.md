# Hi, I'm Jeremiah.

<p>I’m a Californian living in Stockholm, Sverige (Sweden). I have worked for InVision, Spotify, Fitbit, Disney, Apple, and a bunch of failed startups. I currently work for Stripe.</p>

## Tidbits

- I once shared my experience switching to Mac OS X in a commercial for Apple. I said my legal name in the commercial and I had an above average online presence in 2002. This resulted in much unwelcomed contact and criticism for a high school student who hadn't yet figured himself out. It also led to several incredible friendships and job opportunities. This was an experience that happened *to* me, as opposed to something I accomplished. It was exciting at the time, but I'd much rather talk about the active decisions, accomplishments, and failures in my life.

- I popularized the phrase “developer experience” (DX) to describe the use of user experience research and design methodologies for developer-focused products. Prior to my [writing and speaking at conferences](/speaking/), there were no Google results for the use of this phrase in this manner.

- I have worked at three failed startups. I've been a co-founder (Digital Dandelion), a first hire (Awe.sm), and employee 50 (GoTV Networks). I now prefer companies that have both started and up'ed.

- I am a Democratic Socialist. I believe in capitalism and a guaranteed basic income. I agree with Robert Reich on most economic issues.

- I am a supporter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Demand Progress, and probably anything Larry Lessig establishes. I believe that the right to privacy is a requirement for the right to free speech. We'd be crazy to not fight for both.

- I survived a helicopter crash. It was my first time riding in a helicopter. I've taken one helicopter ride since then. As far as I'm concerned, helicopters only have a 50% success rate.

- I have been an environmentalist since I was 10.

- I am a secular humanist and atheist.

- I am gay. My identity has been defined more by the struggle for acceptance and equality of my sexuality than by my sexuality. I think of myself as many other things before being a gay man. I hope this is what equality eventually should feel like.
