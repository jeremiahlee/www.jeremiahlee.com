<p>You are welcome to anything in the kitchen and pantry. The coffee and grinder are in the cabinet below the coffee maker. The coffee maker looks different, but it‚Äôs got the same parts you‚Äôre used to, only sexier because it‚Äôs European.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Don‚Äôt take out cash.</strong> 99% of businesses only accept cards.  </li>
	<li>Chip-and-PIN has been standard here for over 2 decades, but most US cards require signatures. Officially, merchants must then examine your passport and write your info on the receipt you signed. It‚Äôs a hassle. Carry a pen, be apologetic to the store owner, and complain to your US bank.  </li>
	<li><strong>Alternatively, use <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or <a href="https://pay.google.com/about/">Google Pay</a>.</strong> Most places accept contactless payments. Mobile contactless payments generally don‚Äôt require a signature. Look for this symbol: <img src="/guestroom/contactless-payment.webp" alt="oval with 4 radiating waves in rightward direction beside hand holidng a rectangle"></li>

<h2 id="getting-here-from-the-airport">Getting here from the airport (Stockholm Arlanda ARN)</h2>

<h2 id="taxi"><strong>By Taxi</strong></h2>

<p>The easiest, but most expensive, way from the airport is by cab. The ride is about  45‚Äì60 minutes at a fixed ~900 SEK.</p>

<p>You want to pick <strong>Taxi Kurir</strong> or <strong>Svierge Taxi</strong> at the Taxi stand, others will charge much more. </p>

<p>Each cab company has a line of cars when you leave the terminal. </p>

<p>Everyone speaks English, but cab drivers slightly less so. Tell them you‚Äôre going to: <strong>Nacka</strong>. Mannagrynstorget 2 (pronounced: Man-nah-greens-tore-ee-at). Show them the address. The cab driver will likely need to look up the the price in a book. They will use the nearest neighborhood name to find the ‚Äúfast pris‚Äù the fixed price - tell them <strong>Henriksdal</strong> if they ask. </p>

<h3 id="transit"><strong>By Public Transport</strong></h3>

<p>The Arlanda Express is the ‚Äúmost environmentally friendly way to get to and from Stockholm Arlanda Airport‚Äù and might be the fastest way during rush hours.</p>

<p>Follow signs once you exit Customs to the train. Buy a ticket at the machine ~300 SEK. Enjoy the 20 minute ride into the city. Use the Wi-Fi on the train to load the Google Maps directions to our home. You will arrive at Central Station (T-Centralen).</p>

<p>Follow the signs for the ‚ÄúT‚Äù Tunnelbana. This is the subway. You might not be riding the subway based on which option you pick below, but you will need to buy a ticket either way. The T is a time-based system that allows you to ride all the buses, trains, and ferries you can fit in for 75 minutes. </p>

<p>You can just tap a credit card to get on. You can also <a href="https://sl.se/en/eng-info/fares/app/">download the SL app</a> to purchase transit tickets for a period of days, but some people have had difficulty paying with cards from banks outside the EU in the app.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong><br>This is the easier, but slower option. Leave the station and walk towards the <strong>Centralen</strong> bus stop. (You loaded the Google Maps directions linked above, right?) Ride the 53 bus to <strong>Henriksdalsviadukten</strong> (~16 minutes). You will be a 4-minute walk away from our apartment. Follow Google Maps to our place. </p>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong><br>This is the faster, but more complicated option. Look for the trains 13, 14, 17, 18, or 19 and the stop: <strong>Slussen</strong>. Take the train to the second stop, Slussen, and exit towards Nacka buses. Follow the signs outside of the station to the busses. This will involve walking down a gerbil-maze of corridors over a construction zone. You‚Äôll pass a McDonald‚Äôs and go down stairs. Take bus 25B, 409, 414, 442, 443, 444, 471 to <strong>Henriksdal</strong> station. This is a digital sign that has when each of these bus lines leaves and which bus loading zone letter to wait at. Cross the street and follow Google maps the few blocks to our house.</p>
