<p>The devil is in the details. Here are some tiny decisions most people won’t notice, but brought me joy to include. Most recent easter eggs are at the top.</p>

<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>If you visit my website in a Chromium-based browser, many pages will show a fake advertisement for Firefox at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2 id="lgbtq-erg"><a href="/posts/lgbtq-erg/">How to start a supportive LGBTQ+ employee resource group</a></h2>

<p>View source to read the full truth.</p>

<h2 id="last-burp-of-hope"><a href="/posts/last-burp-of-hope/">The Republican Party’s Last Burp of Hope</a></h2>

<p>The mouse cursor changes to the waiting/loading cursor when hovering over the 5 stars at the bottom of the article. Each star represents a US territory that could became a full state. No taxation without representation. Pack the Senate. I believe Democrats should adopt a 55 state strategy.</p>

<h2 id="delete-facebook"><a href="/posts/delete-facebook/">Move away and fix things (Delete Facebook)</a></h2>

<p>The design of this post was a near pixel perfect recreation of the Facebook Web app at the time.</p>

<p>The background images used in the &quot;posts&quot; were actual post background options from Facebook.</p>

<p>Each &quot;posts&quot; was &quot;liked&quot; by amusing groups. Jezebel, Salome, and Delilah are notable rejects in the Bible. The comments are from <a href="https://www.npr.org/" title="National Public Radio">NPR</a> journalists. The copyright notice post is liked by <a href="https://www.lessig.org/">Larry Lessig</a>, one of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2005/10/12/ccinreviewlawrencelessigonhowitallbegan/" title="CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on How it All Began">founders</a> of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.</p>

<h2 id="failed-squad-goals"><a href="/posts/failed-squad-goals/">Spotify’s Failed #SquadGoals</a></h2>

<p>The article title is inspired by the 2015 cultural phrase <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/84734-what-does-squad-goals-mean-heres-what-you-should-know-about-this-term?ref=JeremiahLee">squad goals</a> and the weird usage of the word <em>squad</em> to mean team in the Spotify organizational model.</p>

<p>The cover illustration features a photo of Spotify’s Birger Jarlsgatan headquarters in Stockholm. The women are Taylor Swift and her song-described squad from her music video <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo">Bad Blood</a></cite>. Taylor Swift and Spotify have had a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15767986/taylor-swift-apple-music-spotify-statements-timeline">troubled relationship</a>.</p>

<p>The font used is the closest free version to Spotify’s brand font I could find. The colors are actual Spotify brand colors.</p>

<p>Spotify used duotone photos in much of its 2010s marketing, so I put the “speak no evil” monkey emoji in duotone.</p>

<p>The quote boxes were inspired by the Spotify 2019 Wrapped campaign design.</p>

<p>The orange and pink spikey background was inspired by the header on Spotify’s public relations website.</p>
