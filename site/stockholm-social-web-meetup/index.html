<p>First event in November! More information coming soon.</p>

<p>In 2023, millions of people experienced a digital displacement. Policy changes at Twitter and Reddit disrupted online communities. Many migrated to a new kind of social network that allows them to follow friends and interesting people without intrusive advertising, questionable algorithms deciding what they should see, or a new CEO banning them arbitrarily.</p>
<
p>The next great social network is just the Web. A new technology standard (ActivityPub) turns any website into a social network profile that can be followed, liked, and commented upon. It allows people and organizations to fully own their online presences, digital relationships, data, and control of their experiences.</p>

<p>Over 10 million people are now using social web apps, including the <a href="https://social.network.europa.eu/about">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2023-07-mastodon-distributed-decentralised-fediverse-activitypub">the BBC</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.nu/@gretathunberg">Greta Thunberg</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This meetup will be accessible to everyone, not just technologists.</strong> Please come if you are an influencer, marketer, activist, artist, or just a lover of cat memes.</p>
